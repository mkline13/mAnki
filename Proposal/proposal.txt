# CS 399 Final Project Proposal
Description: A flash card study app modeled after Anki

## Core functionality
The user should be able to accomplish the following:
 - Create and edit flash cards contained in "Decks"
 - Add flash cards to "Study Piles"
 - Study the flash cards contained in "Study Piles"
 - Edit the settings and contents of "Decks" and "Piles"
 - View statistics about study sessions, cards, etc.
 - Searching for cards
 
The app should implement some kind of rudimentary SRS algorithm to optimize study sessions for time and recall.

## Possible Features
 - "Quick Add" feature for rapidly adding new cards to any deck
 - Embedded images in flash cards
 - Embedded audio files in flash cards
 - Ability to quickly add images to cards with a URL
 - When browsing cards, filtering by Pile and Deck and sorting by various card attributes
