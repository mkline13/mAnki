REQUIRED:

- make local backup and merge with main branch
- UITests


OH wait, why is it running the scene delegate during tests? This probably explains the weird CoreData errors and the problem below.


IF POSSIBLE:
troubleshoot flashCardService.delete tests
why can I not delete first Content Pack?


UI TESTS:

FIRST: rewatch the UITest video

- Make a content pack and assert all views + controls are there
- Open card browser + edit pack settings
- Add cards to the content packTest
- Create a deck + add the content pack
- auto add cards and begin studying
- study and hit failure through all cards
- then hit success
- then verify the buttons are disabled
